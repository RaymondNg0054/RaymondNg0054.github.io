    <h1>LLM Geocoding</h1>
    <p>I was playing around with Google's Geocoding API when I thought to plug in an address to o1 for shits and
        giggles. Imagine my surprise when it actually got it right down to the first 3 decimal places (precision of
        within hundreds of meters)! Considering the fact that it got in the near vicinity without any internet access at all, that's pretty impressive.
