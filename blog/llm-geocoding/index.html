    <h1>LLM Geocoding</h1>
    <p>I was playing around with Google's Geocoding API when I thought to plug in an address to o1 for fun and
        curiosity's sake. Imagine my surprise when it actually got the coordinates right down to the first 3 decimal places
        (precision of within hundreds of meters)! Considering the fact that it got in the near vicinity without any
        internet access at all, that's pretty impressive. Naturally, the next step was to host a battle royale with a
        bunch of other widely-used LLMs to see which one is best for this "offline" geocoding (yes, I'm considering
        closed-source LLMs in this, just imagine you're in the book <i>Project Hail Mary</i>, and you have access
        to
        every computer program ever).</p>

    <p>I first created a dataset of 25 locations with the coordinates from Google Maps as the source of truth.</p>

    <p>Next, I chose 7 LLMs to compare [o1, claude-3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek v3, gemini-2.5-pro-experimental,
        llama_3_1_405B_instruct, llama_4_maverick_17B_128E_instruct].</p>

    <p>Then, I gave the dataset with all of the coordinates removed to each LLM with this prompt:</p>

    <code>Given these addresses, give the coordinates for each of them. I do not want any code to find these out or any services. Just give it your best shot to get the coordinates to 12 decimal places in Latitude and Longitude columns. Output your answer in CSV format.</code>

    <p>Lastly, I plotted all of the given coordinates on a map.</p>

    <div id="map"></div>

    <script src="js/map.js"></script>
    <p>As you can see, results widely vary depending on model used and the part of the world the point is located. Here
        are some things that I found interesting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DeepSeek R1 will not answer any queries relating to Taiwan, but DeepSeek V3 will.</li>
        <li>DeepSeek V3 sucks for getting coordinates for addresses on the West coast for some reason.</li>
        <li>The more well known your location is, the more accurate it will be.</li>
        <li>Breadth of knowledge in LLMs is better than I expected. 4/8 got in the vicinity of the address in Comstock,
            Nebraska (no offense to the residents of Comstock).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>If you for any reason wanted to get coordinates of an address without the use of the internet, but you somehow
        had access to every single LLM on the planet (and a supercomputer), Gemini would be the way to go. However, if
        you live in this
        reality, your best choice would be DeepSeek R1, closely followed by LLama 4 Maverick 17B 12E Instruct. Honestly,
        LLama 4 would probably be the way to go if you were actually trying to run this, since it requires the least
        amount of resources (it can be run on a laptop!).
