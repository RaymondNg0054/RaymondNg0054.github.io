    <h1>LLM Geocoding</h1>
    <p>I was playing around with Google's Geocoding API when I thought to plug in an address to o1 for shits and
        giggles. Imagine my surprise when it actually got it right down to the first 3 decimal places (precision of
        within hundreds of meters)! Considering the fact that it got in the near vicinity without any internet access at
        all, that's pretty impressive. Naturally, the next step was to host a battle royale with a bunch of other
        widely-used LLMs to see which one is best for this "offline" geocoding.

        I first created a dataset of 25 locations with the coordinates from Google Maps as the source of truth.

        Next, I chose 7 LLMs to compare [o1, claude-3.7-sonnet, deepseek_r1, deepseek v3, gemini-2.5-pro-experimental, llama_3_1_405B_instruct, llama_4_maverick_17B_128E_instruct].
